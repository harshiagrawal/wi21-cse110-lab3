          <p class="marginPractice"> My name is Harshi Agrawal, and I am a 3rd year CS student at UCSD. <br>
          I am excited to learn HTML and I am making this site for my CSE 110 class.<br>
          As part of my extracurriculars on campus, I am a social chair member on Women in Computing's board. <br>
          I am also an employee on campus at Canyonview Aquatic Center and in Delta Gamma.</p>

          <p> Here are some of my hobbies outside of school: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Going to the beach</li>
            <li>Traveling</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Spending time with friends and family</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p> However, here is how I would rank my hobbies from most favorite to least favorite: </p>
          <ol>

            <li>Traveling</li>

            <li>Cooking</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p> One of my favorite songs to listen to (even though it is a major throwback is Pocketful of Sunshine. If you have not heard it, here it is: </p>

          <h2> Women in Computing: </h2>
          <p class="intro"> As an organization, our colors for WIC is <span style="color:purple">purple</span>. We use various shades of this color because we try to 
          represent our organization as welcoming and warm. I love being part of WIC on campus, so I wanted to go more in depth about it. 
          Something I am <i>very very </i> passionate about is diversity, especially in the tech industry. Being a woman <b class="term">AND</b> a minority in this field, 
          I strive to inspire other young women to not be intimidated. Something I really want to emphasize is to <strong> never give up</strong>. 
          With these motives, I knew I <em> had </em> to join WIC. I want to be a part of a community that understands what it is like to be in a minority group and be able to support one another in this journey. 
          Women in Computing has allowed me to do that. I love to talk to others and give advice on how to get internships, how to network, and how to be successful in your career.</p>
          
          <h3> WIC Summer Project: </h3>
          <p> As a part of board, I decided to take part in redesigning and coding the website over the summer. 
          It allowed me to learn front end languages such as JavaScript and practice git commands such as <code> git status </code>.
          It also gave me the opportunity to bond more with my fellow board members who had also volunteered, so it was overall a great experience.
          Here is a screenshot of what the front page of our site looks like: </p>

          <h3> WIC Hours: </h3>
          <p> Over the past year, I have spent a lot of time in WIC, whether that was going to meetings or planning events. Here is a table that shows 
          approximately how many hours I spent each quarter on WIC related things: </p>
          
          <table>

            <tr>
              <th>Quarter</th>
              <th>Hours</th>
            </tr>
